## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5
- CSS (custom properties)
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Responsive design for:
- Mobile width: 375px
- Desktop width: 1440px
- Google Fonts – Outfit (weights 400 & 700)

### What I learned
This project helped me practice:

- Creating centered layouts using Flexbox
- Managing consistent spacing with padding and margin
- Making text flow responsively using line-breaks
- Applying mobile-first design principles
- Using font and color guidelines provided by a design spec
- Writing clean and maintainable CSS

Here’s a snippet I used to manage line-break control for the paragraph:

p {
  max-width: 250px;
  text-align: center;
  line-height: 1.4;
  word-break: break-word;
}

### Continued development

Going forward, I’d like to:

- Improve my skills in responsive typography
- Experiment with utility-first CSS frameworks like Tailwind CSS
- Learn how to implement accessibility (WCAG) standards more rigorously
